# app-collection
A collection of programs personally written, packaged into one main program.

The main window of this application runs through the 'BaseFile_ApplicationCollection.py' module.
Currently, this only includes one program -- 'Column Transverse Designer'. Other programs intended to be
included in this main program are still under development.

COLUMN TRANSVERSE DESIGNER

This calculates the required reinforcements of a column for its ductility requirements, as per the American Concrete Institute (ACI) structural code.

The program features single column analysis, which is capable of saving the results to an external file. Single file analysis results are saved to a text file and can be loaded back to the program, as needed. Program can also produce a PDF copy of the calculations.

This program is also capable of handling batch analysis. Basically, it loops the single file analysis in order to conveniently analyze multiple sets of data. Data handling is done through Excel API.
